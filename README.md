## 💡 What it does

  🗣️ speak to your device of choice <br>
  Your favorite LLM is ready to answer (here Qwen3 by default)<br>
  Or just interact via keyboard ⌨️ via console or web interface <br>
  It should just work like any home assistant.<br>
  The default keyword to activate speech detection is **"Ok Mars"** (configurable)

- **required** :
  
  - one PC equiped with a microphone and a speaker. Tested on :
      - **Jabra Speak2**
      - **Jabra Speak 810**
      - **Seeed Studio respeaker mic array V2.0**
        
- ATM if you want a custom keyword, it is **mandatory** to create a Picovoice account (check [Picovoice](https://picovoice.ai/)), train and download a custom keyword to get a working pipeline.
  - **Meteo** : It can search for meteo infos using your OpenWeather API key
  - **Pokemon** : Look for any Pokemon info using Tyradex API (french) or PokeApi (english, others...)
  - **Wikipedia** : Make Wikipedia searches using the python API
  - **Vector Search** : stores all in a synthetic way in chromadb if needed and can retrieve the memorized info
  - **t2yLLM** is meant to work on a 16GB GPU, but in order to achieve that, first launch the LLM backend script in order to avoid OOM

- [ToDo](#%EF%B8%8F-todo) <br>


### I/ Install
- Install pytorch for your cuda version (see https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) :<br>
  `pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128 `<br>
  for cuda 12.8. <br>
  For now on Blackwell GPUs, you need to uninstall current and install nightly :<br>
  `pip3 install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128`
  
- Install vllm : `pip install vllm --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128`<br>
  if you have Blackwell, you should follow : `https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/getting_started/installation/gpu.html#use-an-existing-pytorch-installation`<br>
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.git
  cd vllm
  python use_existing_torch.py
  pip install -r requirements/build.txt
  pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
  

- (Optional) Install flash attention 2 [flash-attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention)

- Clone the repository :
  `git clone https://github.com/Saga9103/t2yLLM.git`<br>
  `cd t2yLLM`<br>
  `pip install -e .`

### II/ Basic examples
- See examples in **./examples** on how to use and import

- **AssistantEngine** class receives user prompts (text/str) generated via Faster-Whisper, browses APIs if needed, generates an answer
  (token by token with the async engine of vllm) and forwards it to the dispatcher.
  the related python script should be installed on your server/desktop.
 ![llm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d15d89c2-ce67-4571-b4b5-cb123fb0be7b)


  
- the **VoiceEngine** class runs **Faster-Whisper, piperTTS, silero-vad and porcupine**. It is responsible for :
  - transforming answers generated by llm_backend_async.py to audio chunks (in .flac via piperTTS) and send them over udp to your
  raspberry Pi.
  - getting audio from the raspberry Pi and converting it to text via Faster-Whisper with as low latency as possible.
  this script should be installed on your server/desktop (by default, the same as llm_backend_async.py but it can be different).
![dispatcher](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63539894-c2ec-486a-a2fd-2eab4d055220)



### III/ Configuration
- the .yaml config files should be used to tweak paramaters like silence, models, directories etc...

- You can check models I use in the config files and also in the faster_whisper directory. **To make things work on a 16GB gpu 
it needs quantization. You also need to fully load the llm_back_async.py first** via llm_example.py. Should have no problem on 24GB GPUs.

- Different parameters of vLLM can be used to save VRAM like enforce_eager, max_model_len etc... vLLM documentation is very rich

  - console mode :

- **Web UI** for interactive talk and displaying code or math formulas /examples/llm_example_webui.py :

## 🔥 Backends

- **vLLM** : really fast and well documented inference pipeline for your favorite LLM
- **Faster-Whisper** : incredibly fast STT for realtime text generation (*see model used here :* [model](https://github.com/Saga9103/t2yLLM/blob/main/faster-whisper/faster_whisper/README.md))
- **piperTTS** : fast text to speech generating natural voice, maybe the best for french atm
- **Silero-vad** : process the audio buffer and prevents whisper hallucinations
- **pvporcupine** : keyword detection
- **Chromadb** : a vector search database that serves as the model memory
- **default LLM** : Qwen3 14B or other variants, GPTQ 4Bit quantized
- **Pytorch**
- **FastAPI**
- **Librespot**

## 💡 Specifics

### Material :

  - A 16GB GPU for default config
  - Jabra Speak2, Jabra Speak 810, Seeed Studio respeaker mic array v2.0 --> tested
  

### Pipeline :
  - **t2yLLM** uses **AsyncLLMEngine from vLLM** in combination with **faster-whisper** in order to generate text from speech and stream tokens as fast as possible.
  - In distributed mode : The audio dispatcher processes text received from the LLM and transforms it to .flac segments and
    sends them to the client (raspberry Pi)
  - Sound reveived from the Jabra Speak2 or the Raspberry-Pi 5 is analyzed by **silerovad** to detect speech in addition to **pvporcupine**
  - Relevant sound is then translated by **Faster-Whisper** with low latency
  - The audio dispatcher transforms the LLM answer to speech with **piperTTS** and then sends audio parts in .flac
    over the network to reduce bandwidth usage and decrease latency

## ⚙️ Parameters

- configuration should be done via the .yaml config file without having to directly interact with the code
- configuration can be enhanced via the YamlConfigLoader.py
- **t2yLLM** should be used on local network only since all is in clear text for now

## ⚙️ Environment variables

create a .env file and use python-dotenv or edit your ~/.bashrc :

- export PORCUPINE_KEY='myporcupinekey'
- export OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY='myopenweatherkey'
- export VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND=FLASH_ATTN #for V1 engine
- export VLLM_FLASH_ATTN_VERSION="2"       #for V1 engine

- Plugins have to be activated and deactivated via config
- List of **supported plugins** :
    - date
    - time
    - weather
    - wikipedia
    - pokemon
    - yeelight *
    - Spotify *
 
* yeelight and Spotify are harder to set up, read the [setup](https://github.com/Saga9103/t2yLLM/blob/main/t2yLLM/plugins/README.md) process first.

## 🛠️ ToDo

- async memory handler for non blocking operations when dealing with memory
- WebOS plugin implementation
- Cut Voice when math formulas or code is detected
- use FastAPI errors
- use pydantic for UUID validation
